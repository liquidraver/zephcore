# ZephCore - Main Project Configuration
#
# This file contains ONLY console/logging setup and includes common configs.
# Platform-specific configs are in boards/common/<platform>_common.conf
# Board-specific configs (pins only) are in boards/<board>.conf
#
# Include hierarchy:
#   prj.conf (this file - logging/console)
#   → boards/common/zephcore_common.conf (app features, crypto, sensors)
#   → boards/common/<platform>_common.conf (BLE, flash, storage)
#   → boards/<board>.conf (pins, board-specific features)

# ========== Console & Logging ==========
CONFIG_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN=y
CONFIG_RING_BUFFER=y

# Logging subsystem — enabled by default (prod.conf disables with CONFIG_LOG=n).
# Log tuning (buffer size, backends, etc.) is in boards/common/logging.conf,
# which CMake auto-includes only when prod.conf is NOT active.
CONFIG_LOG=y

# ========== Power Management ==========
# Note: nRF52840 automatically uses WFI (Wait For Interrupt) in idle thread.
# Power savings come from event-driven design: CPU sleeps in WFI whenever
# k_event_wait() blocks. GPS standby uses GPIO power control (not PM_DEVICE).
# CONFIG_PM_DEVICE intentionally DISABLED — it enables SYSTEM_MANAGED PM which
# auto-suspends all devices (including GNSS) during idle, calling modem_chat
# from an unexpected context and potentially deadlocking the system.
