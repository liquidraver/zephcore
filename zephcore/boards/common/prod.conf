# Disables logging for smaller binary and lower power consumption.
# USB CDC still works for CLI commands on repeaters.

# Disable logging subsystem (saves ~62KB flash, ~2-5mA power)
CONFIG_LOG=n

# Disable asserts (saves flash, removes CMake warning)
CONFIG_ASSERT=n

# Disable SEGGER RTT (saves ~4KB RAM ring buffer + init code)
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n

# Disable thread name strings (saves flash — only useful for debug)
CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=n

# Max contacts: Kconfig default is 350 (safe for 100KB ExtraFS).
# Do NOT set here — EXTRA_CONF_FILE overrides board.conf, which would
# prevent boards with more storage (Wio QSPI=510) from raising the limit.
