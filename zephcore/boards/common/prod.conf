# USB CDC still works for CLI commands on repeaters.

# Disable logging subsystem (saves ~62KB flash, ~2-5mA power)

# Max contacts for production (App protocol limit: 510, encoded as uint8 * 2, so you can set it higher, but the current app can't display it or work with it)
# Check board configs for overrides — too low RAM can freeze the device.
