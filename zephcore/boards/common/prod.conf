# Disables logging for smaller binary and lower power consumption.
# USB CDC still works for CLI commands on repeaters.

# Disable logging subsystem (saves ~62KB flash, ~2-5mA power)

# Disable asserts (saves flash, removes CMake warning)
CONFIG_ASSERT=n

# Disable SEGGER RTT (saves ~4KB RAM ring buffer + init code)
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=n

# Disable thread name strings (saves flash — only useful for debug)
CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=n

# Max contacts for production (App protocol limit: 510, encoded as uint8 * 2, so you can set it higher, but the current app can't display it or work with it)
# Check board configs for overrides — too low RAM can freeze the device.
