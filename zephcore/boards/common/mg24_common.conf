# EFR32MG24 Platform Configuration
# Included by all MG24-based boards (XIAO MG24, etc.)
# Only contains MG24-specific settings — common BLE/Storage/Input is in zephcore_common.conf
#
# Include order: prj.conf → zephcore_common.conf → mg24_common.conf → <board>/board.conf
#
# NOTE: MG24 uses Silicon Labs proprietary BLE controller blob.
# Requires: west blobs fetch hal_silabs

# ========== BLE: MG24-specific controller settings ==========
# DLE managed internally by Silabs blob — no CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX
# TX power managed internally by Silabs blob — no CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_*

# BLE thread stacks — Silabs blob needs larger stacks
CONFIG_BT_TX_PROCESSOR_STACK_SIZE=2048

# Controller assert handler — without this, a controller assert silently
# freezes the CPU at highest IRQ priority with zero log output.
CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ASSERT_HANDLER=y

# ========== Debug ==========
CONFIG_ASSERT=y

# ========== Heap ==========
# Silabs BLE stack requires larger heap (override zephcore_common 2KB default)
CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=32768
