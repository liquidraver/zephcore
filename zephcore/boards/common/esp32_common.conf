# ESP32 Platform Configuration
# Included by all ESP32-based boards (XIAO ESP32-C3, XIAO ESP32-C6, etc.)
# Only contains ESP32-specific settings — common BLE/Storage/Input is in zephcore_common.conf
#
# Include order: prj.conf → zephcore_common.conf → esp32_common.conf → <board>/board.conf

# ========== BLE: ESP32-specific controller settings ==========
# DLE managed internally by Espressif blob — no CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX
# TX power managed internally by Espressif blob — no CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_*

# BLE thread stacks — ESP32 software BLE controller needs larger stacks
CONFIG_BT_TX_PROCESSOR_STACK_SIZE=2048

# ========== Heap ==========
# ESP32 BLE stack requires larger heap (override zephcore_common 2KB default)
CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=32768

# ========== Debug ==========
# Generic Zephyr assert (ESP32 uses Espressif BLE blob, not sw_split controller,
# so BT_CTLR_ASSERT_HANDLER is not available)
CONFIG_ASSERT=y
