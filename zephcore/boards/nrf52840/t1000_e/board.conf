# Seeed Tracker T1000-E board configuration
#
# Hardware:
# - LR1110 LoRa on SPI (P0.12 CS, P1.10 RST, P0.07 BUSY, P1.01 DIO1)
# - L76K GPS on UART0 (P0.13 TX, P0.14 RX), enable P1.11
# - Battery ADC on AIN0 (P0.02), 2.0x voltage divider
# - LED green (P0.24), Button (P0.06)

# Board identification (matches Arduino variant name)
CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_BOARD_NAME="T1000-E"

# Device Information Service model name
CONFIG_BT_DIS_MODEL_NUMBER_STR="Seeed T1000-E"

# Radio type (TCXO, RF switch, PA config in DTS)
CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_RADIO_LR1110=y

# SPI for LR1110
CONFIG_SPI=y

# PWM for buzzer
CONFIG_PWM=y

# T1000-E has no display — disable to enable LED heartbeat
# (HAS_HEARTBEAT_LED requires !CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_UI_DISPLAY)
CONFIG_ZEPHCORE_UI_DISPLAY=n

# Debug logging removed — GPS and BLE confirmed working at protocol level.
# Re-enable selectively with: -DCONFIG_BT_CONN_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y etc.
# Heavy debug logging contributed to BLE freeze (stack pressure + RTT blocking).
